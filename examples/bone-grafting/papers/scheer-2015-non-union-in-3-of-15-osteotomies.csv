Summary of Findings,"Non-union occurred in 3 of 15 osteotomies of the distal radius without bone graft, particularly when a trapezoid defect was created. This suggests reconsideration of bone grafting.",inferred,The study found a concerning rate of non-union (3 out of 15 cases) in distal radius osteotomies performed without bone grafting.,2,0,0,0,0

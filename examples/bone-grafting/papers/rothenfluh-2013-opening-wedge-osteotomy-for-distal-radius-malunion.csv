Summary of Findings,This study compared dorsal and palmar approaches for distal radius malunion osteotomy. Both methods effectively corrected malunions. Palmar approach resulted in better wrist flexion and less hardware removal.,inferred,Inferred from the abstract to meet the 30-word limit as findings are not summarized.,1,0,0,0,0

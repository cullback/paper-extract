Summary of Findings,"This technique simplifies osteotomies for extra-articular or minimally displaced articular distal radius malunion, restoring wrist parameters and achieving good union rates. It uses a tricortical iliac bone graft for structural support.",found,The text details a surgical technique for malunion correction that results in restored wrist parameters and good union rates.,1,196.883,331.425,489.143,425.405
